__All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.__

This is based off of [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

There are no real _releases_, or _tags_ here since this is not a library
or anything, but I felt like it would be fun (besides just git history)
to keep a log of how the site has changed over time.

This should be in reverse chronological order.

### 2024-01-02

#### Changed

- `zola` updated to `0.18.0`.
- `Makefile` updated to reflect changes in zola since the last version.
  - Specifically, serve broke [here](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pull/2258),
  and we needed to debug zola (adding a `ZOLA` ENV var to make sure we can
  use the same `Makefile` and point it to a different binary.
  - And updated output-dirs to use absolute paths as a workaround for that same issue.
  - Opened a [PR](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pull/2398) to fix this.

### 2023-01-08

#### New

- `hermit` manages `make` as well.
- have some minimal support for a table of contents.

#### Changed

- No longer doing date based permalinks, that was annyoing for how little I was writing.

### 2022-08-23

#### New

- Support `hcl` syntax highlighting ([source][hcl]).

#### Updated

- Zola is now `0.61.1`.

#### Fixed

- With the updated version of zola (not sure when), code blocks were rendered
  differently than prior versions, which would break the highlighting/formatting
  of the blocks. This is now fixed.

### 2021-12-31

#### New

- Zola is now managed with [`hermit`](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/shell/).

#### Updated

- Updated to using [`zola 0.15.2`](https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases/tag/v0.15.2).
  Pretty sure I was running a custom build before.

#### Fixed

- The `image` shortcode needed to be fixed to work with the
  [`resize_image` functionality](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/image-processing/).
- Reverse chronological post order on the homepage.

### 2019-12-15

#### New

- Support / styling for the `<details>` element.
- Support for a `snippet` shortcode to pull in `details` from `static/details`

### 2019-11-17

#### New

- Image resizing support and styling using the `image` shortcode.

#### Updated

- Only one HTTP request for the page (inlining the CSS, and empty favicon data).
  This made it so that the `build` and `serve` commands write to the same
  directory :( Since we don't _really_ know how to inline something from various
  paths. The config doesn't have output path available at runtime.

### 2019-11-14

#### New

- Support and styling for [anchor links][anchor-links] on posts.
- `Makefile` supports the env var `$BASE_URL`, this is useful if
  I want to check the site from my phone during development, using
  [internet sharing on MacOS][internet-sharing].
- Adding a `CHANGELOG.md`, which is symlinked and served as `/changelog`.

#### Updated

- `bin/verify-content-dates` updated to use symlinks for the autogenerated
  section `_index.md` files.
- Better sizing/spacing for mobile web.
- The post [How this site works](@/writes/how-this-blog-works.md)
  was updated to reflect the fixes to the `CNAME` (bug fixe below) and the
  symlinking dates directories.

#### Fixed

- No longer have to deal with weird `master` merge issues because
  `bin/ship` force pushes master. This was a problem before because
  the master branch _needs_ to have a `CNAME` file for custom domains
  to work well. Fixed by symlinking it to `static/` the same way that
  the REAMDE is, and this file is.
