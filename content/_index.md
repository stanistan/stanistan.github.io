Hi, I'm Stan, sometimes referred to as stanistan.

I used to lead the Traffic Team at [Cash App].
Also at [Etsy], where I worked on lots of things as a
Software Engineer & Product Infrastructure Architect; an
alumn of the [Recurse Center]; and a perpetual work in progress.

You can find some of my work on [github].
