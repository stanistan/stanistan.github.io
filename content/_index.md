Hi, I'm Stan, sometimes referred to as **stanistan**.

I used to lead the Traffic Team at [CashApp][cash], and was an
Engineer and the Product Engineering Architect at [Etsy][etsy].
I'm also a 2x alumn of the [Recurse Center][rc]; and perpetual work in progress.
You can find some of my work on [github], and of course _here_.
